In this project, I analyzed the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices. I performed data preprocessing by converting string data types to categorical, imputing missing values with the median, and encoding categorical variables as numerical codes. I selected the Random Forest Regressor for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and capture non-linear relationships. Hyperparameter tuning was done using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance. The final model was evaluated using RMSE, and feature importance analysis identified the most influential predictors. This project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and extracting insights from complex datasets.
